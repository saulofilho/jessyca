This isn’t just a regular product film, this a product film with real stories. For the launch of Motorola G-stylus, we selected three artists who use their work for a greater good, sending an important message: 

Alma Negrot, a makeup artist and performer who breaks the barriers of makeup and conservatism. 

Nina Satie, an illustrator who represents in her art the beauty and power of black women.

And Kauê Lentini, a chef who cares about the origin and the whole cycle of the food he makes.

I am happy to be able to put such incredible artists in a global campaign, valuing their work and showing it to the whole world.

Fun fact: my hand was used in the film. Seconds of hand fame, baby.
