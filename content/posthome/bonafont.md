Bonafont was the main sponsor of the 2021 edition of the festival of the creative club SÃ£o Paulo and wanted to present a brand new bottle: made without lable and 100% recycled. so we created a version of the ccsp award, but just like our bottle: 100% recycled, made out of the same bottles used during the festival. to conquer it, everybody who was watching the festival had to let out their creativity through an augmented reality instagram filter of the campaign.
