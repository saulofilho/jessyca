Toddy is a famous hot cocoa brand, in Brazil, popular among the young ones. To get closer to the target, and also impact the parents, we had an idea involving a popular behaviour in Brazil: the use of cheesy GIFs by the family in Whatsapp.

So, we created exclusive GIFs, to bring more originality to WhatsApp families groups. But it wasnâ€™t any GIF. Each of them had a code to be used as a discount coupon on Rappi, a delivery app.

GIFs were hosted on GIPHY and released on social networks by various influencers and fans of the brand. Yummy and pretty cool.\
