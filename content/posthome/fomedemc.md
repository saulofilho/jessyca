This client everyone's know, doesn't need extra explanation.

I had the opportunity to help this campaign with the creation of their new concept and tagline. #FomedeMc means: hungry of Mc Donalds. The inspiration to this concept was my family. Between us, were super common to say that we weren't hungry of any burguer, but hungry of Mc.

A popular way to put the brand, again, literally at brazilians mouth.

We also wanted to bring “food porn” for the brand, play with the petit appeal.
