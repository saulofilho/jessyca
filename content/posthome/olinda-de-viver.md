This one is emotional, grab a tissue.

Olinda de Viver is a L'Occitane Au Br√©sil fragrance inspired by the everyday joy of Olinda (a city of Pernambuco, Brazil) woman. For the launch of the perfume, on Mother's Day, we created a film that explores the colors and architecture of the city, showing all the little joys and beauty of being a mother.
