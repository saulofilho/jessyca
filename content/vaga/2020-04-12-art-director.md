  Design Directors are the driving force keeping the creative side of Huge at
  the top of its game. They make sure no talent goes to waste and the work stays
  sharp and relevant. Design Directors develop original design concepts, global
  marketing campaigns, and digital media. You're able to output your best work
  while overseeing multiple projects from creativity and execution, to directly
  managing a large team of creatives.

  Huge's Design Directors are responsible for managing client relationships related to all things creative, including pitches, and proposals. We want a Director who's craft is high and likes getting her/his hands dirty when needed: you lead by example and you can show how it's done. You'll lead one of Latin America's best design teams, and you'll be the counterpart for Medellin's Design Director.
