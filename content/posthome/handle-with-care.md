The advancement of human actions is driving species toward extinction at an alarming rate, threatening biodiversity and putting this fragile balance at risk. Only in Brazil, more than 3,000 species of flora and 1,000 of fauna are under threat of extinction.

Greenpeace wants people aware of the fragile situation of biodiversity. So, we created a print campaign in which people can feel the fragility of animals' and plants' life in their own hands.Â 

The prints were made thinking about the final objective, which was the feeling of fragility when touched, and most importantly, with eco-friendly paper and ink.
