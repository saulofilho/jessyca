This project was a new and amazing experience that I have the pleasure to participate. MESA, put together a lot of professionals to help create a new brand: GAL, a beauty salons chain. 

Gal was just an idea of passionate young investors that we helped become a structured brand, with visual identity, concept and storytelling.
