Will is a digital bank that is starting in Brazil. Its first campaign had Brazilian funk as music, making the brand adhere to a fun and popular language. To continue in the musical field, we invited a trans rapper, Danny Bond, who was very successful in Brazil with a remix of her music with Doja Cat. 

Danny Bond, created a song talking about how the Will Bank Card gives her independence to be able to have fun and do whatever she wants, totally p*ssy power lyrics. We created a clip for the song made exclusively for social media, showing what the bank's digital world would be like. The clip was so successful that the song ended up on Spotify.

And the most important thing about this campaign is that Danny was the first black trans woman in brazil to be the face of a bank.
